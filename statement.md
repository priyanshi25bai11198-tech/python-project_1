Library Management System - Statement
Problem Statement
Managing library books manually is tedious and error-prone, especially when tracking which books are available, borrowed, or returned. A simple, automated system is needed to efficiently add books, show available books, allow users to borrow and return books, and keep an updated count of the library's collection.

Scope of the Project
This project implements a basic library management system in Python. It handles book additions, displays current book inventory, supports borrowing and returning of books, and maintains an accurate count of books. The system operates in-memory without database integration but can be extended further. The project's scope includes management of a collection of books and basic user interactions with the library catalog.

Target Users
Small libraries and community centers with limited resources for digital management

Students learning programming concepts through a practical library system

Developers seeking a base project for library software to build upon and customize

High-Level Features
Add new books to the library collection

Display all books currently available in the library
